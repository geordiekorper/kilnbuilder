# kilnbuilder
Kilnbuilder is a website that allows you to try out various design concepts for a train kiln.

The files can be used locally from your drive or more commonly you would copy them to a webserver. The canonical site that uses it is kilnevaluator.com.

This readme will be fleshed out later after the initial tasks related to getting the project into github are completed.
